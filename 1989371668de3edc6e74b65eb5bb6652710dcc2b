      "message": "Having said that, it appears to be a problem to find an alternative replacement in Java world to experimental @Delegates annotation of `lombok` for delegation pattern implementation: [1], used in `GitHubRepository` class:\n\n```\n  @Delegate private GHRepository ghRepository;\n```\nThe only thing I found was Kotlin native support for that feature: [2]. Of course, Bazel has support for `rules_kotlin`: [3], but I don\u0027t think we should migrate this plugin or `GitHubRepository`class only to Kotlin because of this feature ðŸ˜Š\n\nOf course, we could try delombok: [4] to run as a preprocessor step, and even commit the result as the source, and use it in follow-up build toolchain, or alternatively try to integrate it, as bookingcom folks have done here: [5], WDYT?\n\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern\n[2]: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/delegation.html\n[3]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_kotlin\n[4]: https://projectlombok.org/features/delombok\n[5]: https://github.com/bookingcom/rules_lombok_java_library",
